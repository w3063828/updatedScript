	load the navball lib
	get parameters 
		AP height
		heading for launch or target inclination
		launching along a heading(FALSE) or inclination(TRUE))
		NOTE: inclination for v2
	check for a atmosphere
	turn off RCS

	go no go check 
		RCS on for go
		print target height
		print target inclination (soulth or north) or heading
		print body atmosphere
	throttle to full
	count down?
	stage

start flight for set heading
	lock controls 
		to pitch of 90		
		to heading of heading heading parameter
	when vertical speed is between 50 and 100 / if there is no atmosphere 25 NOTE: need testing 
		SET pitch to 80 OR 85 / if there is no atmosphere 45 posably lower NOTE: need testing
	next step after a wait of 5 to 10 seconds NOTE: need testing
	
main flight for set heading
	lock controls to surface prograde / if there is no atmosphere lock to orbit prograde
	start throttle PID
		throttle PID looking at time to AP trying to keep at 60s NOTE: might want to lower # of seconds need testing
			KP of 1
			KI of 0.1
			KD of 0.1
	run until AP height is the same as the AP parameter
	
circulise orbit 
	try to get prograde heading
	lock controls to pitch PID and prograde heading (constent check)
		pitch PID looking to keep AP height at parameter pitch down if it is high up if low
		keep runing throttle PID keeping time to AP (AP - PE) / 1000 NOTE: need testing
	run until PE is close to AP with in 1000 NOTE: need to test for a good number

Done with program


start flight for inclination set
	lock controls 
		to pitch of 90		
		to inclination
			for inclination set 90 - inclination parameter (include degree wrap) + headingPID 
				headingPID how far off inclination, KP about 0.1, KI about 0.01, KD about 0.01
	when vertical speed is between 50 and 100 / if there is no atmosphere 25 NOTE: need testing 
		SET pitch to 80 OR 85 / if there is no atmosphere 45 posably lower NOTE: need testing
	next step after a wait of 5 to 10 seconds NOTE: need testing
				
main flight for inclination set
	lock controlls
		heading to +/- 5 baced on how far off from inclination the craft is
			NOTE: include logic for high latitude flight
		pitch to surface prograde pitch
		once inclination is less than 5 deg lock heading to the heading of orbital prograde +/-5 baced on how far off from inclination the craft is
			NOTE: may need inversion logic for if the trejectory is a soulth launch
